## Context and research question

The research investigates the applicability and effectiveness of various ML algorithms  in crafting anomaly-based IDS **(Intrusion Detection Systems)** tailored for IoT environments.

**It presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of
diverse supervised machine learning algorithms. Leveraging a complex IoT-specific dataset
encompassing various IoT devices and a spectrum of attack scenarios, this research seeks to
identify the most effective ML algorithms for anomaly-based IDS in IoT.**

## Data

**ToN-IoT** dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and cybersecurity professionals looking to study and address the security challenges posed by IoT and IIoT networks. 
Its heterogeneity, labeling, and inclusion of various attack types make it a rich source of data for developing and testing security algorithms and systems.

In this dataset, there are nine types of cyber attacks that were launched against various IoT and IIoT sensors within the network, as follows:

* Scanning
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Denial of Service (DoS)
* Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
* Backdoor
* Injection Attack
* Password Attack
* Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)
* Ransomware

## Classification algorithms used:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
* Naive Bayes
* Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
